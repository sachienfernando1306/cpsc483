# CPSC 483 Final Project

This is an implementation of a Simplified Graph Convolutional Network for Text Classification. This project takes heavily from the [TextGCN ]([url](https://github.com/yao8839836/text_gcn))and the [SGC]([https://github.com/Tiiiger/SGC/](https://github.com/Tiiiger/SGC/)) repos. It has been modified for use for Python 3.11, since those projects were specifically meant for previous Python versions. 

Requirements can be found from the _requirements.txt_ file. 


```
python train.py --dataset <dt> --tuned
```

See `tuning.py` for the tuning details.
